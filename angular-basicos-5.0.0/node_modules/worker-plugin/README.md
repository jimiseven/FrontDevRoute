<p align="center">Automatically bundle & compile Web Workers within Webpack.</p>


### Features

Automatically compiles modules loaded in Web Workers:

```js
const worker = new Worker('./foo.js', { type: 'module' });
                          ^^^^^^^^^^
                          gets bundled using webpack
```

The best part? That worker constructor works just fine without bundling turned on, but when bundled the result is **supported in all browsers** that support Web Workers - all the way back to IE 10!

Workers with fully dynamic URLs, Blob URLs, data URLs or with no `{ type:'module' }` option are left unchanged.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D worker-plugin
```

Then drop it into your **webpack.config.js:**

```diff
+ const WorkerPlugin = require('worker-plugin');

module.exports = {
  <...>
  plugins: [
+    new WorkerPlugin()
  ]
  <...>
}
```

> **Note:** If you're planning on having more than one worker, you'll need to make sure [`output.filename`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#outputfilename) is set to something dynamic, e.g. `"[name].bundle.js"` otherwise the generated filenames will overwrite one another. 

## Usage

**worker.js**: _(our worker module)_

```js
// This is a module worker, so we can use imports (in the browser too!)
import { calculatePi } from './some-other-module';

addEventListener('message', event => {
  post
